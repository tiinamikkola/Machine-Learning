Machine learning project: Predicting absolute strength of powerlifters using regression methods.

How to use: I recommend reading the file "Predicting absolute strength of powerlifters using regression methods.pdf" that introduces the topic and methods used.
Jupyter Notebooks code and all output is found in the file "Project-final.ipynb".
